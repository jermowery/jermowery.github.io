## Ingredients

- 3 Tbsp cocoa powder

3. Remove from heat and pour into a lightly greased dish
4. Let rest until cool enough to handle, about two minutes
5. Form into small balls (with greased hands) and roll over sprinkles or crystal sugar
6. Place the balls in small candy cups and eat at once or chill until serving
