## Ingredients

### Filling

- 4 cups frozen mixed berries\*, NOT thawed (about 24 ounces frozen fruit)
- 3 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 3 tablespoons all purpose flour
- zest from 1/2 lemon
- pinch of salt

### Topping

- 1 cup old fashioned rolled oats
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 6 tablespoons all purpose flour
- 1 stick (1/2 cup) salted butter, cold, cut into small cubes

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees with the oven in the middle position.
2. In a mixing bowl, make the berry filling by combining all ingredients and tossing to combine. Set aside.
3. In a separate mixing bowl, make the oat crumble by combining all ingredients, then use your fingers to pinch the butter and incorporate with the dry ingredients. Keep pinching and tossing together with your hands until evenly combined. You will be left with many pea sized pieces of butter mixed in with the oat mixture. Set aside.
4. Pour the berry filing into a 1-1/2 quart baking dish (or 8×8 pyrex baking dish, a pie baking dish, or even cast iron skillet). Top with the oat crumble topping, and spread to an even layer.
5. Bake uncovered until the berry filling is bubbling, and the oat crumble is golden brown, about 1 hour.
