[Original](https://themodernproper.com/hungarian-mushroom-soup)

## Equipment

- Large soup pot

## Ingredients

- 1 stick (8 Tbsp) butter
- 4 cups onions, chopped (~2-3 medium onions?)
- 2 lb mushrooms, sliced
- 1 serrano chili, thinly sliced (optional)
- salt, to taste
- cayenne powder, to taste
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 4 cups chicken or vegetable stock
- Herbs:
  - 1 Tbsp dried dill
  - 1 Tbsp minced fresh thyme leaves
  - Substitute or add: rosemary, tarragon, fresh sage. If fresh, can also just include whole sprig and fish it out later
- 1 Tbsp paprika
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 cup whole milk
- 1/3 cup flour
- 1/2 cup sour cream (or yogurt)
- 1/4 cup lemon juice
- optional goat cheese or parmesan for flavor (1/4 cup? idk)
- optional eggs (2?) for heartiness
- 1/4 cup fresh Italian parsley (for garnish)

## Instructions

1.  In a heavy pot or Dutch oven, saute the onions over medium heat until onions are soft and translucent.
2.  Add mushrooms (thinly sliced serrano chili, if using) and continue sauteeing for ~10 minutes (mushrooms not quite fully cooked but getting soft).
3.  Add salt and cayenne, to taste.
4.  Add the white wine and let the alcohol cook off briefly. Then add herbs, paprika, chicken or vegetable stock, and soy sauce. Bring the soup to a simmer and cook until the liquid reduces by half.
5.  Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the flour into the milk until smooth. Add the flour-milk mixture to the soup and cook until the soup begins to thicken, about 10 more minutes.
6.  Turn the heat down to low and slowly stir in the sour cream (or yogurt) and lemon juice. You can add the optional parmesan/goat cheese now.
7.  Partially blend the soup with an immersion blender (blend 3/4s of the soup?)
8.  If adding eggs, whisk in separate bowl and then slowly pour eggs in thin stream into the soup pot, stirring gently.
9.  Garnish the soup with parsley and serve hot.

\*\*Yields 10 cups of soup. (original recipe recommended doubling the recipe if serving it as a main, so that has already been done here).
