## Ingredients

### Dough

- 1 cup milk
- 1 egg
- 4 Tbsp butter
- 3 1/4 cups flour
- 1/2 cup (brown) sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1 1/2 tsp dry yeast

## Fruit

- 1/2 cup golden raisins
- 1/2 cup (3/4 cup) slivered almonds
- 1/2 cup [candied fruit](../candied_orange_and_lemon_peel)
- finely shredded lemon peel (optional)
- finely shredded orange peel (optional)

## Instructions

{{< notice >}}
Using the sweet cycle of the bread machine (mine does the dough cycle in 1:20 min). It works well in the machine, but I end up baking it in the oven (it looks a little more like the original).
{{< /notice >}}

1. Combine milk, egg. butter, flour, brown sugar, salt, baking powder, and dry yeast in the bread machine
2. Set the bread machine on the sweet/dough cycle (about 1:20 minutes)
3. After 20 minutes add the fruit
4. Finish the sweet/dough cycle
5. Warm your oven (for 2 minutes), grease a baking sheet with butter. Cover it with a thin layer of flour.
6. Split the dough into 2 loaves and place onto baking sheet
7. Let dough rise in the warm oven for 1 hour, then remove from the oven. (A trick from my mom and sisters: put a small ball of dough in a glass of water, when it floats, it's ready for baking.)
8. (optional) cover loaves with slice almonds before baking
9. Pre-heat oven to 375 F.
10. Bake the loaves for 15-20 minutes.
11. (optional) baste loaves with butter and powdered sugar

Enjoy! (Not optional)
