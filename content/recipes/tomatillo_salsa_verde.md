## Equipment

* Pan for broiling tomatillos (can also just use regular baking sheet)
* Foil for pan to make cleanup easier
* Blender and/or food processor for combining ingredients

## Ingredients

* 1.5 pounds tomatillos
* 1/2 cup chopped white onion
* 1 clove (or more) garlic, crushed (optional)
* 1/2 cup chopped cilantro leaves and stems
* 1 lime (juice)
* 2-3 jalapeño or serrano peppers, (I use 3 whole serrano peppers, but you can also remove seeds if you want it less spicy)
* Salt to taste (1/2 tsp?)

## Instructions

1.  Preheat the broiler, setting the rack about 6 inches from the heating element.
2.  Remove the papery husks from the tomatillos and rinse well. Cut the tomatillos in half and place cut side down on a foil-lined baking sheet.
3.  Remove stems from the peppers (and optionally seeds) and add them to the foil-lined sheet as well.
4.  Place under a broiler for about 5-7 minutes to lightly blacken the skins of the tomatillos.
5.  Roughly chop the onion, and squeeze the lime juice over it; set aside.
6.  Combine half the cooked tomatillos, half the peppers, and all the rest of the ingredients (onions, lime, cilantro, crushed garlic, salt) in the blender or food processor, puree
7.  Check spice and salt level
8.  Add the rest of the tomatillos, and as many of the rest of the peppers as you want based on the current spice level
9.  Pulse until you reach desired chunkiness
10. Pour salsa into bowl and mix to check for large chunks/tomatillo skins. If there are any chunks that are too large, return them to blender and pulse/puree. Repeat until satisfied.
11. Cool, then refrigerate (or just eat it fresh, it's delicious then too)
