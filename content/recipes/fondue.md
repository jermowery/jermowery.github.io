## Equipment

- Fondue pot
- Fondue fuel
- Fondue forks

## Notes

- Most fondue pots can only handle 1200g of cheese mixture
- Best served with 1/2 small baguette per person
  - Cut less than you think you will need to prevent left overs from going stale because the cheese is very filling
- Cheese can be substituted, just ask the cheese person at the store for a substitute for a fondue
- It is best to note start mixing the cheese until after guests arrive to avoid clumping

## Ingredients

- 200g gruyere
- 200g appenzeller
- 200ml "sekt" (sparkling wine?) + some to dissolve the cornstarch
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1/2 large onion
- Chili flakes and/or cayenne
- 1 tbsp cornstarch (up to 1 tsp more to adjust consistency)
- The juice from 1/2 a lemon up to 1 whole lemon, to taste

## Instructions

1. Crush the garlic and mince the onion
2. Saute the garlic and onion
3. Add 200ml wine, lemon juice, and chili flakes/cayenne and bring to a simmer
4. Add the cheese a bit at a time stirring constantly
5. Once the sauce is smooth and thin, dissolve 1 tsp cornstarch in sparkling wine and then mix it in, then wait a minute to see if it's thick enough before potentially doing it again.
   - Careful: with too little starch, the cheese mixture is too liquid, but if you add too much it gets doughy and tasteless
6. "As soon as the consistency is optimal" (thanks uncle) move it from the stove top to the fondue pot
