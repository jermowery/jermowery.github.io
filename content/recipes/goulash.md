## Ingredients

- 2 lb beef chuck (anything labeled stew meat works)
- 1 tsp salt
- 2lb potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1lb carrots, peeled and chopped (non-traditional but delicious)
- 2 Tbsp paprika
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 onions, diced
- 2 bell peppers, diced
- 1-2 diced tomato cans

## Instructions

1. Chop onions and brown in oil
1. Add chopped bell peppers and tomatoes to onions and saute until softened
1. Add beef (chopped into 1 inch squares), ground paprika, and bay leaves. Let
   beef simmer in its own juice for two hours on low heat (if it seems dry you
   can add just enough water to almost cover all ingredients)
1. Add diced potatoes and remaining salt. Stir, then add just enough water to
   just barely cover everything. Cover and simmer until potatoes are done (40+
   minutes) and meat is tender.
