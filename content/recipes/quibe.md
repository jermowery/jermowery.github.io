## Ingredients

- 2 lbs bulgar wheat (~5.5 cups)
- 5.5 cups of boiling water (1:1 with the bulgar wheat by volume)
- 4 lbs ground beef (2:1 meat to bulgar wheat by weight)
- 1 packet of mint (stems removed)
- 2 large onions
- Olive oil (enough to cover the onions similar to the amount needed for sauteing)
- 2 tbsp salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2. Set aside a 9x13 baking pan and a 9x9 baking pan.
3. Pour boiling water over bulgar wheat in a bowl, set aside to soak for about 20 minutes. (The next steps take about 20 minutes).
4. Food process onion and mint (pulse not to a paste).
5. Add olive oil and salt to onion and mint.
6. Once the bulgar and water mixture has finished soaking mix together with the onion, mint, olive oil, and salt mixture.
7. Taste test the bulgar mixture, it should be very salt. This is your last chance to taste test before adding the raw meat. The mixture needs to be salty enough to still be salty after adding the raw meat.
8. Mix meat and bulgar mixture together in a giant bowl, using your hands to pinch the ingredients together.
9. Pour the meat mixture into the pans. Pat flat. Use a knife to cut it in one direction and then the other to create a grid as if you are cutting to serve.
10. Bake in the oven until cooked through, about 35-40 minutes.
11. Broil until top is golden brown and crusty, about 3-5 minutes.
