## Prework:

Preheat oven to 325
Lightly grease 9x5 loaf pan

## In a large bowl mix:

- 2 cups flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- ½ tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 T cinnamon

## In a separate bowl mix:

- 1½ cup mashed overripe bananas (3-4)
- 1/3 cup sugar
- ¾ cup vegetable oil
- 2 eggs
- 1 T vanilla
- Optionally some other fruit (e.g. 1-2 apples) cut small

## Put it all together:

1. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten.
2. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.
3. Bake in preheated oven for 60-70 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into
   center of the loaf comes out clean.
4. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, and then turn out onto a wire rack.
