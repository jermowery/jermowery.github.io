## Ingredients

### Pasta

- 4c vegetable broth (standard package size)
- 16oz pasta (shells work well, standard package size)
- 4-5 medium zucchini cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 8oz mascarpone, crème fraîche or softened cream cheese (standard package size)
- 1 large garlic clove, crushed
- 1/6 cup packed thinly sliced basil
- Salt to taste
- Cayenne to taste

### Gremolata

- 9 tablespoons chopped roasted salted almonds
- 9 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley
- 1/2 cup packed thinly sliced basil
- Salt to taste

## Instructions

### Pasta

1. In a 12-inch pot, bring stock to a boil over high heat. Once stock boils, stir in pasta,
   zucchini, mascarpone, garlic and half the basil; season generously with salt and cayenne and
   reduce the heat to medium-high.
2. Cook, stirring frequently, until pasta is tender and liquid is reduced until thickened and
   creamy, 12 to 13 minutes, adding a splash of water during the last few minutes of cooking if
   needed to moisten. Season to taste with salt and cayenne.

### Gremolata

1. Chop almonds and parsley with remaining basil in a food processor until finely chopped and
    combined; season with salt.
