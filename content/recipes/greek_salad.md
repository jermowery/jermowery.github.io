## Notes

* I have no desire to specify amounts. Let your heart be your guiding key.

## Ingredients

* Tomatoes, medium dice
* Bell peppers, short strips
* Cucumber, peeled and diced
* Onion, minced
* Kalamata olives, sliced lengthwise
* Feta (either crumbled, or in small dice)
* Dried oregano
* Olive oil
* Salt, to taste (the feta and olives have salt, but you'll still need a bit for the tomatoes/crosswords)

## Instructions

1. Mix it all together and eat.
2. Okay fine if I were doing it I'd probably start with the olive oil, oregano, salt, onion, and tomato, but I don't think it really matters.
