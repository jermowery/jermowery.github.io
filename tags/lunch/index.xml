Cooking the chicken breast can be a little tricky, and will end up a bit dry if you do it wrong. Chicken thigh is more forgiving.

Okay fine if I were doing it I&amp;rsquo;d probably start with the olive oil, oregano, salt, onion, and tomato, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it really matters.</description></item><item><title>Osaka Sauce</title><link>https://mowery.dev/recipes/osaka_sauce/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mowery.dev/recipes/osaka_sauce/</guid><description>Originally stolen from The Mustard Seed

I&amp;rsquo;ve made it my own over the years; feel free to do the same! The original recipe called for peeling the tomatoes, and left everything to marinate for an hour before the garlic was removed. I&amp;rsquo;ve removed these steps, but the order of operations in this recipe is designed to allow for maximum marination. However, these are guidelines, not rules&amp;ndash;nothing will be ruined if your prep timing lines up differently than the recipe calls for.</description></item><item><title>Persian Eggplant Stew (Khoresh-e Bademjoon)</title><link>https://mowery.dev/recipes/persian-eggplant-stew/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mowery.dev/recipes/persian-eggplant-stew/</guid><description>Original 1 Original 2
