Adapted and customized from a recipe appearing in a 1940&amp;rsquo;s cookbook, this recipe really hits the spot during summer fresh blueberry season.
You can make it as a traditional pie with a top crust, but the real magic is when you replace the top crust with the optional streusel topping detailed below.
Pie Instructions Preheat oven to 425F. Prepare pie crust. In large bowl, combine blueberries, sugar, flour and cinnamon; toss lightly to mix.</description></item><item><title>Plum Cake (Pflaumenkuchen)</title><link>https://mowery.dev/recipes/plum_cake/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mowery.dev/recipes/plum_cake/</guid><description>Notes: For historical reasons this is named &amp;ldquo;Plum Cake&amp;rdquo; but it is actually a pie.
