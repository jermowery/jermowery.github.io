# Grandma Lonergan's Banana Bread

See original at [matt9j.net/recipes/banana-bread](https://matt9j.net/recipes/banana-bread)

True origins unknown, but refined over many generations, this recipe
makes a delicious soft banana bread. For maximum enjoyment be sure to
not over-cook it, avoid over-mixing once you've combined the dry and
wet ingredients, and consider adding some dark chocolate chips or
favorite chopped nuts!

## 0: Prework:
* Preheat oven to 325
* Lightly grease 9x5 loaf pan

## 1: In a large bowl mix:
* 2 cups flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* ½ tsp baking powder
* ½ tsp salt

## 2: In a separate bowl mix:
* 1 ½ cup mashed overripe bananas (3-4)
* ¾ cup sugar
* ¾ cup vegetable oil
* 2 eggs
* 2 T vanilla (that is not a typo... two tablespoons is correct)

## 3: Put it all together:
1. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten.
2. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.
3. Bake in preheated oven for 60-70 minutes, until a toothpick
inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean.
4. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes...
5. And then turn out onto a wire rack to finish cooling on its own!
