### Broiled Salmon

## The Marinade

* 3 Tb minced onions (or scallions, or shallots) 
* 1 1/2 Tb soy sauce 
* 2 Tb olive oil 
* 1/2 tsp rosemary (ground rosemary) 
* 1 Tb rosemary to sprinkle
* Big pinch pepper or drops of Tabasco 
* Black pepper (optional)
* The juice of 1/2 lemon 
* A broiling pan

## Instructions

Mix the marinade ingredients in a bowl (I run it through the food processor). Lay the salmon flat in the bottom of your broiling pan and spread on half the marinade. Turn the salmon and spread with the rest of the marinade. Leave for at least 20 minutes (if I'm in a hurry, I don't). For the salmon with skin, I just oil the pan with some olive oil, and put the marinate just on top.

## Broiling

This will take only 15 minutes in all.  Set the salmon, just as it is, not too close under hot broiler. No need to turn. I usually take it out when the onion is caramelized; serve immediately.
