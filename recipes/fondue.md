# Fondue

Stolen by Laura from recent uncle

[Original](fondue.jpg)

## Equipment

* Fondue pot
* Fondue fuel
* Fondue forks

## Notes

* For scaling: most fondue pots can only handle 1200g of cheese mixture

## Ingredients

* 200g gruyere
* 200g appenzeller
* 200ml "sekt" (sparkling wine?)
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1/2 large onion
* Chili flakes
* 2 tsp cornstarch
* A little lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Crush the garlic and food-process the onion
2. Saute them with the chili
3. Add the alcohol and lemon (reserve a small amount of the wine to add later) and bring to a simmer
4. Add the cheese a bit at a time
5. Once the sauce is smooth and thin, dissolve 1 tsp cornstarch in sparkling wine and then mix it in, then wait a minute to see if it's thick enough before potentially doing it again.
   * Careful: with too little starch, the cheese mixture is too liquid, but   if you add too much it gets doughy and tasteless
6. "As soon as the consistency is optimal" (thanks uncle) move it from the stove top to the fondue pot
