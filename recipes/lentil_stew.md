# Ingredients

* 1½ cups small lentils, such as Pardina or Puy (12 ounces), or use any size green or brown lentil
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 2 bay leaves
* 2 whole cloves (*optional, I skip this)
* Kosher salt and black pepper
* 4 or 5 medium potatoes (*and/or 5 large carrots), peeled and sliced 3/4-inch thick
* 3 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
* 2 medium leeks, white and tender green parts, chopped in 1/2-inch pieces
* 1 tsp chopped garlic (*just crush several cloves)
* 1 large thyme or rosemary sprig
* 2 Tbsp pimentón dulce or smoked sweet paprika
* ⅛ tsp ground cayenne, or to taste (*moar)
* Small pinch of saffron (about 12 strands), soaked in 1/4 cup cold water (*optional)
* 1 cup chopped canned tomato with juice
* 2 Tbsp sherry vinegar (can substitute red wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar)
* Chopped parsley (optional)

# Instructions

Note: the lentils and leeks start out in two separate pots, then both end up in the same pot with the lentils. In the comments on the original, someone suggests making everything in one pot, but this version lets you start cooking the lentils sooner, which is the time bottleneck of this recipe.

## For the lentils
1. Rinse the lentils.
1. In a Dutch oven or large, heavy-bottomed pot, saute the diced onion in some olive oil.
1. Add the lentils, 8 cups of water, and the 2 bay leaves (and cloves, if using).
1. Bring to a boil over high heat, add a large pinch of salt, then reduce heat to a simmer.
1. Cook with lid ajar for about 20 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, chop the potatoes/carrots.
1. After those 20 minutes are up, add the potatoes and/or carrots, along with more salt, then cook for 10 more minutes (until lentils are soft).
1. Turn off heat.

## For the leeks
1. Put 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
1. When the oil is wavy, stir in the chopped garlic. Push it around and make sure it doesn't burn.
1. ~30 seconds later, add the leeks and stir to coat.
1. Season with salt and pepper.
1. Let leeks cook briskly, stirring frequently until soft but still bright green, about 5 to 8 minutes.
1. Turn heat to medium, stir in thyme, pimentón and cayenne.
1. Add saffron and soaking water, the chopped tomato, and vinegar.
1. Turn heat to high and let everything simmer for a few minutes.
1. Pour contents of skillet into the pot the lentils are in.

## Once combined
1. Bring the lentils to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
1. Cook covered with lid ajar for about 10 minutes.
1. Taste and adjust seasoning, then cook for 10 more minutes. The lentils will be quite soft and the potatoes will start to break.
1. Discard thyme or rosemary sprig and bay leaves.
1. Finish with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and chopped parsley, if you wish.
