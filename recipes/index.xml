Adapted and customized from a recipe appearing in a 1940&amp;rsquo;s cookbook, this recipe really hits the spot during summer fresh blueberry season.
You can make it as a traditional pie with a top crust, but the real magic is when you replace the top crust with the optional streusel topping detailed below.
Pie Instructions Preheat oven to 425F. Prepare pie crust. In large bowl, combine blueberries, sugar, flour and cinnamon; toss lightly to mix.</description></item><item><title>Osaka Sauce</title><link>https://mowery.dev/recipes/osaka_sauce/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mowery.dev/recipes/osaka_sauce/</guid><description>Originally stolen from The Mustard Seed

I&amp;rsquo;ve made it my own over the years; feel free to do the same! The original recipe called for peeling the tomatoes, and left everything to marinate for an hour before the garlic was removed. I&amp;rsquo;ve removed these steps, but the order of operations in this recipe is designed to allow for maximum marination. However, these are guidelines, not rules&amp;ndash;nothing will be ruined if your prep timing lines up differently than the recipe calls for.</description></item><item><title>Persian Eggplant Stew (Khoresh-e Bademjoon)</title><link>https://mowery.dev/recipes/persian-eggplant-stew/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mowery.dev/recipes/persian-eggplant-stew/</guid><description>Original 1 Original 2
