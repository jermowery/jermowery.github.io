# Ingredients

The ingredients below do not have quantities. Use amounts that you find tasty

* Minced garlic (to taste)
* Red pepper flakes (to taste)
* (optional) toasted sesame seeds
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Sesame oil (a little goes a long way)
* Green beans
* Soy sauce (diluted in water so it's not so strong)

# Instructions

1. Saute minced garlic, red pepper flakes, and optionally toasted sesame seeds in a generous amount of extra virgin olive oil and bit of sesame oil
2. Stir fry the green beans. Cover and let its own moisture soften it some. Repeat this every few minutes until desired tenderness. (Adjust the heat so it doesnâ€™t burn, add a bit of water if it gets dry before it is soft enough)
3. Add soy sauce
