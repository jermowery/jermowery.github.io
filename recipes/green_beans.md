# Ingredients

The ingredients below do not have quantities. Use amounts that you find tasty

* Minced garlic (to taste)
* Red pepper flakes (to taste)
* (optional) toasted sesame seeds
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Sesame oil
* Green beans
* Soy sauce (diluted in water so it's not so strong)

# Instructions

1. Fry minced garlic, red pepper flakes, and optionally toasted sesame seeds in a generous amount of extra virgin olive oil and bit of sesame oil
2. Fry the green beans in the oil mixture until desired tenderness (adjust the heat so it doesn't burn, add a bit of water if it gets dry  before it is soft enough). Start with the lid on and take the lid off every few minutes to stir and prevent burning
3. Add soy sauce
