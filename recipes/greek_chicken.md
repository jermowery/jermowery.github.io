## Notes

* This recipe calls for chicken breast, but it can also be made with boneless skinless chicken thigh. Cooking the chicken breast can be a little tricky, and will end up a bit dry if you do it wrong. Chicken thigh is more forgiving.

## Ingredients

* 2 lbs chicken breast
* 1 Tbsp dried oregano
* Salt to taste (maybe 2 tsp?)
* 2 large or 4 medium cloves garlic, crushed
* Olive oil

## Instructions

1. Into a large bowl, peel and crush the garlic. Add the olive oil, salt, and oregano.
2. Slice the chicken breast across the grain, in slices 1/4 to 1/3 inches thick (if it's chicken thigh, try to keep slice thicknesses even, but don't worry about the grain)
3. Mix the sliced chicken into the prepared marinade. You can let it sit for a bit if you have other things to do, but that's not necessary.
4. You will cook the chicken in batches. The idea is to give each slice enough space that it can fry nicely--if pieces are too close together the chicken will release water as it cooks and boil instead, leading to dryer and less tasty chicken.
   1. Add a small amount of oil to a hot pan over medium-high heat.
   2. Spread out chicken slices in a single layer. There doesn't need to be a huge amount of space between pieces, but try to avoid overlap as much as possible. A fork may be useful for moving chicken pieces around.
   3. Once chicken has cooked for few minutes and is starting to brown on the bottom, flip each piece over.
   4. Set aside any utensils you've been using on the chicken to this point (perhaps setting them in the bowl with the remaining raw chicken); you'll re-use them for future batches but only during stages ii.-iii., when the chicken is raw.
   5. Once the chicken has again cooked for a few minutes, give the chicken a stir.
   6. Repeated step v. until the chicken has browned nicely, then dump it into a serving bowl. Begin the next batch of chicken (depending on how much oil there is in the pan, you may not need to add any more)
5. Enjoy!
