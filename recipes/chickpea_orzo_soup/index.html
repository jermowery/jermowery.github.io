Equipment Large soup pot Ingredients 1 stick (8 Tbsp) butter 4 cups onions, chopped (~2-3 medium onions?) 2 lb mushrooms, sliced 1 serrano chili, thinly sliced (optional) salt, to taste cayenne powder, to taste 1 cup dry white wine 4 cups chicken or vegetable stock Herbs: 1 Tbsp dried dill 1 Tbsp minced fresh thyme leaves Substitute or add: rosemary, tarragon, fresh sage. If fresh, can also just include whole sprig and fish it out later 1 Tbsp paprika 1/4 cup soy sauce 2 cup whole milk 1/3 cup flour 1/2 cup sour cream (or yogurt) 1/4 cup lemon juice optional goat cheese or parmesan for flavor (1/4 cup? idk) optional eggs (2?) for heartiness 1/4 cup fresh Italian parsley (for garnish) Instructions In a heavy pot or Dutch oven, saute the onions over medium heat until onions are soft and translucent. Add mushrooms (thinly sliced serrano chili, if using) and continue sauteeing for ~10 minutes (mushrooms not quite fully cooked but getting soft). Add salt and cayenne, to taste. Add the white wine and let the alcohol cook off briefly. Then add herbs, paprika, chicken or vegetable stock, and soy sauce. Bring the soup to a simmer and cook until the liquid reduces by half. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the flour into the milk until smooth. Add the flour-milk mixture to the soup and cook until the soup begins to thicken, about 10 more minutes. Turn the heat down to low and slowly stir in the sour cream (or yogurt) and lemon juice. You can add the optional parmesan/goat cheese now. Partially blend the soup with an immersion blender (blend 3/4s of the soup?) If adding eggs, whisk in separate bowl and then slowly pour eggs in thin stream into the soup pot, stirring gently. Garnish the soup with parsley and serve hot. **Yields 10 cups of soup. (original recipe recommended doubling the recipe if serving it as a main, so that has already been done here).

Equipment Pan for broiling tomatillos (can also just use regular baking sheet) Foil for pan to make cleanup easier Blender and/or food processor for combining ingredients Ingredients 1.5 pounds tomatillos 1/2 cup chopped white onion 1 clove (or more) garlic, crushed (optional) 1/2 cup chopped cilantro leaves and stems 1 lime (juice) 2-3 jalapeño or serrano peppers, (I use 3 whole serrano peppers, but you can also remove seeds if you want it less spicy) Salt to taste (1/2 tsp?) Instructions Preheat the broiler, setting the rack about 6 inches from the heating element. Remove the papery husks from the tomatillos and rinse well. Cut the tomatillos in half and place cut side down on a foil-lined baking sheet. Remove stems from the peppers (and optionally seeds) and add them to the foil-lined sheet as well. Place under a broiler for about 5-7 minutes to lightly blacken the skins of the tomatillos. Roughly chop the onion, and squeeze the lime juice over it; set aside. Combine half the cooked tomatillos, half the peppers, and all the rest of the ingredients (onions, lime, cilantro, crushed garlic, salt) in the blender or food processor, puree Check spice and salt level Add the rest of the tomatillos, and as many of the rest of the peppers as you want based on the current spice level Pulse until you reach desired chunkiness Pour salsa into bowl and mix to check for large chunks/tomatillo skins. If there are any chunks that are too large, return them to blender and pulse/puree. Repeat until satisfied. Cool, then refrigerate (or just eat it fresh, it\u0026rsquo;s delicious then too) `,url:"https://mowery.dev/recipes/tomatillo_salsa_verde/"},"https://mowery.dev/recipes/broiled_salmon/":{title:"Broiled Salmon",tags:["lunch","dinner"],content:`The Marinade 3 Tb minced onions (or scallions, or shallots) 1 1/2 Tb soy sauce 2 Tb olive oil 1/2 tsp rosemary (ground rosemary) 1 Tb rosemary to sprinkle Big pinch pepper or drops of Tabasco Black pepper (optional) The juice of 1/2 lemon A broiling pan Instructions Mix the marinade ingredients in a bowl (I run it through the food processor). Lay the salmon flat in the bottom of your broiling pan and spread on half the marinade. Turn the salmon and spread with the rest of the marinade. Leave for at least 20 minutes (if I\u0026rsquo;m in a hurry, I don\u0026rsquo;t). For the salmon with skin, I just oil the pan with some olive oil, and put the marinate just on top.
Broiling This will take only 15 minutes in all. Set the salmon, just as it is, not too close under hot broiler. No need to turn. I usually take it out when the onion is caramelized; serve immediately.

Equipment Fondue pot Fondue fuel Fondue forks Notes Most fondue pots can only handle 1200g of cheese mixture Best served with 1/2 small baguette per person Cut less than you think you will need to prevent left overs from going stale because the cheese is very filling Cheese can be substituted, just ask the cheese person at the store for a substitute for a fondue It is best to note start mixing the cheese until after guests arrive to avoid clumping Ingredients 200g gruyere 200g appenzeller 200ml \u0026ldquo;sekt\u0026rdquo; (sparkling wine?) + some to dissolve the cornstarch 4 cloves garlic 1/2 large onion Chili flakes and/or cayenne 1 tbsp cornstarch (up to 1 tsp more to adjust consistency) The juice from 1/2 a lemon up to 1 whole lemon, to taste Instructions Crush the garlic and mince the onion Saute the garlic and onion Add 200ml wine, lemon juice, and chili flakes/cayenne and bring to a simmer Add the cheese a bit at a time stirring constantly Once the sauce is smooth and thin, dissolve 1 tsp cornstarch in sparkling wine and then mix it in, then wait a minute to see if it\u0026rsquo;s thick enough before potentially doing it again. Careful: with too little starch, the cheese mixture is too liquid, but if you add too much it gets doughy and tasteless \u0026ldquo;As soon as the consistency is optimal\u0026rdquo; (thanks uncle) move it from the stove top to the fondue pot Pictures `,url:"https://mowery.dev/recipes/fondue/"},"https://mowery.dev/recipes/hazelnut_macaroons/":{title:"Hazelnut Macaroons (Nussmakronen)",tags:["dessert"],content:`Original recipe (in German)
Ingredients 3 egg whites (no yolks!) 150g sugar (3/4 cup) (optional) 2 Tbsp vanilla sugar 250g ground hazelnuts (coarser than flour, but still pretty fine) (optional) whole hazelnuts for decoration parchment paper and/or something to grease a baking sheet with Instructions Preheat the oven to 150°C/300°F (or see step 8) Beat the egg whites a little, then add 1 Tbsp of sugar and beat fully stiff One spoon at a time, add the rest of the sugar (including vanilla sugar), and continue to beat for ~4 more minutes until the consistency is thick Gently fold in the ground hazelnuts (optional) Let the dough sit in the fridge for 30-60 minutes to get stiffer With two teaspoons, make small heaps on a greased and/or parchment-paper-lined baking sheet. These will spread out a bit when baking, so not too close together (optional) Place one hazelnut on top of each cookie, in the middle (optional) Let the cookies dry for ~25 minutes. If you didn\u0026rsquo;t actually preheat the oven in step 1, now is a good time. Bake for 16-20 minutes Substitution/optional notes My mom only uses 1/2 cup of sugar Technically the original recipe calls for \u0026ldquo;a packet\u0026rdquo; of vanilla sugar, which is some sort of standard measurement sold in Germany, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to exist in the US. My mom sticks a whole vanilla bean in a jar of sugar, which as time goes on will infuse the sugar with vanilla flavor, and says she thinks she uses about 2 Tbsp. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I\u0026rsquo;ve also made this recipe with no vanilla sugar at all and it was still delicious My mom does not let the batter sit, either before it\u0026rsquo;s scooped onto the baking sheet or after. She thinks this makes them spread out a little more? But they\u0026rsquo;re still delicious The original recipe says 20-25 minutes, but my mom\u0026rsquo;s notes say 16-20, and my grandma\u0026rsquo;s notes say that after the first batch, the oven will be fully hot at which point it\u0026rsquo;ll be faster by 5-10 minutes, so maybe the 20-25 assumes the oven isn\u0026rsquo;t fully preheated? We keep these cookies in a closed container for storage. Sometimes this causes them to clump together into a single solid mass, but you can still break delicious pieces off!

Equipment Stand mixer 2 9 inch round cake pans Ingredients Carrot Cake 2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking soda 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon 1 1/4 cups (295 ml) canola or other vegetable oil 1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar 1 cup (200 grams) lightly packed brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 4 large eggs 3 cups (300 grams) grated peeled carrots (5 to 6 medium carrots) 1 cup (100 grams) coarsely chopped pecans 1/2 cup (65 grams) raisins Frosting 8 ounces (225 grams) cream cheese, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups (140 grams) powdered sugar 1/3 cup (80 ml) heavy whipping cream 1/2 cup (50 grams) coarsely chopped pecans, for topping cake Instructions Batter Heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottom with parchment paper then grease the top of the paper. Or, grease and flour the bottom and sides of both pans. In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and the cinnamon until well blended. In a separate bowl, whisk the oil, sugars, and vanilla. Whisk in eggs, one at a time, until combined. Switch to a large rubber spatula. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then add the dry ingredients in 3 parts, gently stirring until they disappear and the batter is smooth. Stir in the carrots, nuts, and raisins. Baking Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans. Bake until the tops of the cake layers are springy when touched and when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool cakes in pans for 15 minutes then turn out onto cooling racks, peel off parchment paper and cool completely. (If you find that a cake layer is stuck to the bottom of the pan, leave the cake pan upside down and allow gravity to do its thing). Frosting In a large bowl, beat cream cheese with a handheld mixer on medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Beat in the powdered sugar, a 1/4 cup at a time until fluffy. Pour in cream and beat on medium speed for 1 minute. Chill covered until ready to frost cake. When the cake layers are completely cool, frost the top of one cake layer, place the other cake layer on top. Decoratively swirl the top of the cake with remaining frosting, leaving the sides unfrosted.

Ingredients Cinnamon Rolls 4 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast (2 packets) 1 cup lukewarm water 1 teaspoon granulated sugar, to proof the yeast 6 tablespoons shortening or unsalted butter 1 cup granulated sugar 9 cups unbleached all-purpose flour (more if the dough is sticky, up to 10 cups) 2 cups hot water 2 large eggs, beaten 1 tablespoon salt 1/2 cup softened butter, divided 1 1/2 cups brown sugar, divided 1 cup raisins 1 cup pecans 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon, divided 1 cup heavy cream Frosting 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened 4 cups powdered sugar 4 tablespoons milk, more if necessary 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions In a small bowl, combine the yeast and a pinch of the granulated sugar with the lukewarm water and set aside for 5 minutes or until the yeast bubbles up. It will smell “yeasty.”
In the bowl of a stand mixer, add shortening or butter, sugar, and salt to the 2 cups of hot water and beat for 30 seconds, using the beater blade. Let cool to lukewarm temperature. Stir in 2 cups of flour and mix until smooth. Add yeast mixture and mix until well combined. Mix in the beaten eggs.
Gradually stir in the remaining flour and mix with the dough hook for about 2 minutes. Remove dough from the bowl and place on a lightly floured counter. Knead by hand, add a little flour if the dough is still sticky. Knead until dough feels satiny and smooth.
Cover and let rise for 30 minutes. After the dough has doubled in size, remove it from the bowl and divide it in half. With a rolling pin, roll one half of the dough into a rectangular shape, about 22 X 13 inches. Spread dough evenly with half of the softened butter, about 1/4 cup. Sprinkle dough with half of the brown sugar, raisins, pecans, and cinnamon.
Roll up dough into one long roll. Cut rolls, using a piece of dental floss or thread, about two inches thick. Place rolls in greased 9X13-inch baking pans, leaving about 2-inches between the rolls so they have room to rise. Now follow the exact same steps with the other half of the dough.
Cover the pans with a clean kitchen towel. Let the rolls rise until double in bulk. Brush with heavy cream. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake for 20-30 minutes or until cinnamon rolls are golden brown on top and cooked in the middle. Every oven is different so check at 20 minutes to be safe, but it might take longer. You don\u0026rsquo;t want them to be doughy in the middle. Time will also vary based on how big they get during the second rise. Ours take closer to 28-30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let the rolls cool to room temperature.
While the rolls are cooling, make the frosting. In a medium bowl, whisk together butter, sugar, milk, and vanilla. Frost the cooled cinnamon rolls generously!

Cooking the chicken breast can be a little tricky, and will end up a bit dry if you do it wrong. Chicken thigh is more forgiving. Ingredients 2 lbs chicken breast 1 Tbsp dried oregano Salt to taste (maybe 2 tsp?) 2 large or 4 medium cloves garlic, crushed Olive oil Instructions Into a large bowl, peel and crush the garlic. Add the olive oil, salt, and oregano. Slice the chicken breast across the grain, in slices 1/4 to 1/3 inches thick (if it\u0026rsquo;s chicken thigh, try to keep slice thicknesses even, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the grain) Mix the sliced chicken into the prepared marinade. You can let it sit for a bit if you have other things to do, but that\u0026rsquo;s not necessary. You will cook the chicken in batches. The idea is to give each slice enough space that it can fry nicely\u0026ndash;if pieces are too close together the chicken will release water as it cooks and boil instead, leading to dryer and less tasty chicken. Add a small amount of oil to a hot pan over medium-high heat. Spread out chicken slices in a single layer. There doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be a huge amount of space between pieces, but try to avoid overlap as much as possible. A fork may be useful for moving chicken pieces around.

I\u0026rsquo;ve made it my own over the years; feel free to do the same! The original recipe called for peeling the tomatoes, and left everything to marinate for an hour before the garlic was removed. I\u0026rsquo;ve removed these steps, but the order of operations in this recipe is designed to allow for maximum marination. However, these are guidelines, not rules\u0026ndash;nothing will be ruined if your prep timing lines up differently than the recipe calls for. One of the great things in this dish is the thermal contrast when you serve it fresh\u0026ndash;if possible, start with room-temperature tomatoes and fridge-temperature cheese. If it is the heat of summer and you\u0026rsquo;d like to eat something that won\u0026rsquo;t cause you to overheat, the best way to lower the temperature of the final dish is to use fridge-temperature tomatoes. Ingredients Tomatoes, medium dice (6 beefsteak tomatoes, or more if they\u0026rsquo;re smaller) Fresh basil, 3-4 stalks Fresh mozzarella, 16 oz 4 cloves garlic (NOT crushed) Olive oil Salt, to taste Penne pasta, 1 pack Instructions Set the pasta water to boil (I usually add the salt when the water boils, but you do you) Cut the cloves of garlic into a few pieces each. You will need to be able to find these later, so don\u0026rsquo;t make the pieces too small, and count the pieces so that you\u0026rsquo;ll know when you\u0026rsquo;re done. Add the garlic and olive oil to a large bowl. Dice the tomatoes and add them to the bowl. Add salt and stir. Taste test individual tomato pieces as you do\u0026ndash;you want them to be pretty salty because the other ingredients don\u0026rsquo;t have much salt. Also because salt is delicious. Check on the pasta water and salt it/add the pasta if it\u0026rsquo;s boiling. If not, keep an eye on the pot and do it sometime in the next couple steps. Wash and shake dry the basil, then separate the stems from the leaves. If leaves are large, tear them into a few pieces. Add the basil leaves to the tomatoes. Dice the mozzarella, but DON\u0026rsquo;T add it to the tomatoes yet. At this point, you\u0026rsquo;re waiting for the pasta to cook. Set a timer to ring 2-3 minutes before the pasta will be ready. If the pasta\u0026rsquo;s already almost ready, just go directly to step 10. When the pre-pasta timer rings, search for the garlic in the tomato mixture and remove all the pieces (this is why you counted them earlier) Mix in the mozzarella pieces. Once the pasta is ready, drain it and pour it over the tomato/mozzarella mixture. Serve immediately. If there\u0026rsquo;s a few minutes of other prepwork left to do before you can eat (e.g. washing up or garlic bread), I usually don\u0026rsquo;t mix the pasta until we\u0026rsquo;re ready to sit down.

1 tsp turmeric (ground)
1 tsp salt
freshly ground black pepper, to taste
cayenne powder, to taste

1 yellow onion, diced (1/2 for now, 1/2 for later)
2 lbs eggplant, any variety, peeled
olive oil
3 Tbsp tomato paste
(optional, Laura-only addition) 2lbs carrots, peeled and cut into 1/4 inch rounds
28 oz crushed or diced canned tomatoes
1 cup frozen sour grapes (ghooreh) (Do not thaw). May substitute with fresh or pickled sour grapes (rinsed and drained), 4 crushed limoo amani (dried Persian lime), or 3-4 Tbsp fresh lime juice, or lemon juice, or sour grape juice.
1 tsp kosher salt
1/8 tsp saffron powder (optional)
rice, for serving (optionally, make Persian-style rice)
Baked eggplant prep Preheat the oven to 450 F, center rack. Remove and discard the stems. Peel the eggplants and cut them in half, or 1-inch slices if you’re using the American globes. Add the slices to a large bowl and toss with 1/4 -1/3 cup vegetable oil, just enough to barely cover both sides with oil. Cover a large baking sheet with an aluminum foil, letting it extend on all sides to catch any possible splatter. Drizzle one tablespoon vegetable oil on the aluminum foil. Arrange the eggplants on the foil in a single layer. Bake for 20-25 minutes in the preheated oven. The eggplants are ready when you can easily poke them with a fork. Switch the oven temperature to broil setting, with the baking sheet still on the center rack, and broil for 2 minutes to brown the tops. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and cool the baked eggplants in the pan for 20 minutes. The eggplants will easily separate from the aluminum foil with a spatula once cooled. If you try to remove them before they cool, they will stick to the foil. Use the baked eggplants right away or refrigerate for up to 2 days. At this stage the eggplant also freezes very well in an airtight freezer proof container for a month. When ready to use, defrost at room temperature for 30-45 minutes and use in the recipes. Stew prep Cut meat into ~2-inch cubes if it isn\u0026rsquo;t already, and in a bowl add 1 tsp ground turmeric, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper (or to personal preference), and cayenne powder (to personal preference) Dice ½ the onion and saute in olive oil until softened and browned Add the meat and brown it Add 3 cups water (just enough to cover the meat and onions) and then pressure cook (once pressure has started, cook for 15 minutes) Combining the two Heat 3 Tbsp vegetable oil and fry the other ½ onion over medium heat until golden brown. Add 3 Tbsp tomato paste to the fried onions and saute over medium low heat for 5 minutes until aromatic. If a heathen like Laura, add the carrots and fry until somewhat golden Add the canned tomatoes, the broth of the cooked beef and 1 tsp kosher salt and stir to incorporate with the onion mixture. Bring it to a boil to make a sauce. Add the cooked meat, baked eggplants, sour grapes, and the optional saffron and bring it to another boil. Add extra water if needed but only in small amounts so the sauce is not watered down. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for 45 minutes to an hour until the sauce has thickened and the meat, eggplants, (and carrots if you\u0026rsquo;re a heathen like Laura) are very tender.

Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 450°. Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Add 1 cup salt and bring to a boil. Immediately reduce heat to medium-low, bring to a simmer, and cook until potatoes are just cooked through and pierced easily with a fork, about 15 minutes (time will vary depending on the size of your potatoes; be careful not to overcook as they’ll fall apart when smashed). Drain and transfer potatoes to a rimmed baking sheet. Let cool slightly.
Place another rimmed baking sheet on top, then push down firmly to smash potatoes (alternately, use the bottom of a mug or measuring cup to smash each one individually). Drizzle ⅓ cup oil over potatoes, then toss to coat; season lightly with salt and black pepper. Roast potatoes until crispy and golden brown, 35–40 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook walnuts, anchovies, and remaining ⅓ cup oil in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until anchovies are disintegrated and walnuts are golden brown, 6–8 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl, finely grate garlic over, and toss to combine. Mix in raisins and Aleppo-style pepper; season with salt.
Spread sour cream on a large plate. Top with potatoes and spoon walnut sauce over. Scatter herbs over and serve with lemon wedges alongside.

Ingredients 1½ cups small lentils, such as Pardina or Puy (12 ounces), or use any size green or brown lentil 1 medium onion, diced 2 bay leaves 2 whole cloves (*optional, I skip this) Kosher salt and black pepper 4 or 5 medium potatoes (*and/or 5 large carrots), peeled and sliced 3/4-inch thick 3 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 2 medium leeks, white and tender green parts, chopped in 1/2-inch pieces 1 tsp chopped garlic (*just crush several cloves) 1 large thyme or rosemary sprig 2 Tbsp pimentón dulce or smoked sweet paprika ⅛ tsp ground cayenne, or to taste (*moar) Small pinch of saffron (about 12 strands), soaked in 1/4 cup cold water (*optional) 1 cup chopped canned tomato with juice 2 Tbsp sherry vinegar (can substitute red wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar) Chopped parsley (optional) Instructions Note: the lentils and leeks start out in two separate pots, then both end up in the same pot with the lentils. In the comments on the original, someone suggests making everything in one pot, but this version lets you start cooking the lentils sooner, which is the time bottleneck of this recipe.
For the lentils Rinse the lentils. In a Dutch oven or large, heavy-bottomed pot, saute the diced onion in some olive oil. Add the lentils, 8 cups of water, and the 2 bay leaves (and cloves, if using). Bring to a boil over high heat, add a large pinch of salt, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cook with lid ajar for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, chop the potatoes/carrots. After those 20 minutes are up, add the potatoes and/or carrots, along with more salt, then cook for 10 more minutes (until lentils are soft). Turn off heat. For the leeks Put 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is wavy, stir in the chopped garlic. Push it around and make sure it doesn\u0026rsquo;t burn. ~30 seconds later, add the leeks and stir to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Let leeks cook briskly, stirring frequently until soft but still bright green, about 5 to 8 minutes. Turn heat to medium, stir in thyme, pimentón and cayenne. Add saffron and soaking water, the chopped tomato, and vinegar. Turn heat to high and let everything simmer for a few minutes. Pour contents of skillet into the pot the lentils are in. Once combined Bring the lentils to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook covered with lid ajar for about 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning, then cook for 10 more minutes. The lentils will be quite soft and the potatoes will start to break. Discard thyme or rosemary sprig and bay leaves. Finish with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and chopped parsley, if you wish.

Remove from heat. `,url:"https://mowery.dev/recipes/sues_focaccia/"},"https://mowery.dev/recipes/rice/":{title:"The one true rice",tags:["dinner","lunch"],content:"Notes 1 cup of dry rice is probably 4 person-meals, give or take a person-meal. Ingredients X cups dry rice 2X cups water X/2 diced onions (potentially down to X/4 if it\u0026rsquo;s a really large onion) (medium-small dice) Oil (either olive oil or something flavorless, like canola) Salt, to taste (optional) Grated carrots, frozen peas, frozen corn, or other small vegetables. The amount doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter too much but maybe X/2 cups. Instructions (optional) Set the amount of water called for to boil, e.g. in an electric water heater. Saute the diced onions until first translucent, then golden. This can be on high or medium heat, depending how impatient/how much attention you want to pay to them. Add the rice, and saute for a few more minutes. It\u0026rsquo;s good if the rice toasts a bit, but you don\u0026rsquo;t want the rice to burn. Add the water, and salt to taste. You can check the salt content by trying a spoonful of the water. (optional) Add the optional vegetables. Cover the pot with a lid. Once the water boils, turn the heat to low. If you pre-boiled the water, this will happen almost immediately. If you\u0026rsquo;re using a stove that\u0026rsquo;s slow to change temperature, you might need to change to a different/smaller burner. For white rice, set a 20 minute timer; for brown rice, a 50 minute timer. There are two things to check for when seeing if the rice is done. Either of these steps can be repeated. Water at the bottom of the pot: Check by using a wooden spoon to make a well in the rice. Do not stir. If there\u0026rsquo;s still water, set a five minute timer and replace the lid. Hardness of the rice: Check by tasting. If it\u0026rsquo;s still too hard, but there\u0026rsquo;s no water at the bottom of the pot, make a well in the rice and pour in a quarter cup of water, then gently push the rice back into place and check again in five minutes. Do not stir the rice.
